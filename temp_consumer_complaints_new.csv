03/19/2015,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"Due to inconsistencies in the amount owed that I was told by M & T Bank and the amount that was reported to the credit reporting agencies, I was advised to write a good will letter in order to address the issue and request the negative entry be removed from my credit report all together. I had a vehicle that was stolen and it was declared a total loss by insurance company. The insurance company and the GAP insurancw companypaid the outstanding balance of the loan, but I was told by M & T Bank that there was still a balance due on the loan. In good faith, without having received any proof as to why there was still a balance, I made a partial payment towards the remaining debt. I then sent the goodwill letter still offering to pay the remainder of the debt, but in exchange for the removal of the negative entry on my credit report. At one point, in XXXX 2015, per my credit monitoring agency, it showed a delinquent balance of {$0.00}, but when I checked my credit report again on XXXX XXXX 2015, there was a delinquent balance of {$1400.00}.

03/19/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"In XX/XX/XXXX my wages that I earned at my job decreased by almost half, by XX/XX/XXXX I knew I was in trouble with my home loan. I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options. 
In early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months. 
More paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical. 
Wells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan. 
My property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was. 
They can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this. 
I feel that I have been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and would like to pursue legal action against them based on negligence. 
Although my payments are back on track I am not making much more money now than I was before so it is only a matter of time before something like this happens again if something unforeseen happens to my life that affects my finances.

When they were unable to trick me into paying, force me into paying in retaliation they placed reported to my credit bureaus a past due mortgage amount that had been discharged in Federal Court. On XX/XX/XXXX Rushmore responded the referenced complaint indicating that they would remove the reporting from my bureau, yet it is still there now in XX/XX/XXXX.

I was told that I would be getting a good deal on the vehicles in which i purchased. I later found out that the interest rate charged for the loans at the time was almost XXXX times that of the average consumer for the credit score that I had and when I came back to speak to the finance manager. The dealership had let her go for fudging many of the loans and jacking up many customers interest in order to make a higher commission and she was no longer employed with the company due to her increasing many loans on the interest that some of their consumers were paying. The dealership as of today 's date has never contacted me and had i not inquired I would have never known the truth. When I applied my credit score was showing XXXX approximately and thought that I would get the lowest interest rate at the dealership offered but instead I received an interest rate that was nearly XXXX of that of the regular consumer. I am requesting an investigation on the lending of loans and services of this company based on the following Discrimination based on race, and color, gender for I was charged a higher rate than other consumers of a different race, gender or color I request an immediate investigation on the loans that were processed during the time that I applied and it will show this to be a everyday factor practice based on race and to investigate the transactions of this company and how they are advertising a certain price and then selling their vehicles for more than the advertised price. It is like a bait and switch on the consumer. Predatory lending has clearly been an everyday factor in order for the finance department to make a better commissions on the consumer who is not aware of how the process works. I was charged a higher rate for no reason other than greed. Fair and accurate transaction was not taken into account by dealership. Equal credit opportunity act has been was not taken into account. Gramm leach biley act was not taken into account. After purchasing the vehicle I was called back into the office to sign more paperwork again after the vehicle was in my possession for more than a month. I was told that it was necessary in order to get my military discount. I never got the discount on my vehicles and the price of the vehicles was sold for more than they advertised which I later found out from the XXXX ledger. I am still trying to figure out where is the discount and why was I charged a higher interest rate and why did the finance manager deliberately fudge my loan. consumers of a different race who have purchased from this dealership have lower interest rates than mine with lower credit scores than what I had when I purchased my vehicle. As of today 's date their is no discount, higher interest rate, higher price paid for vehicles and the military rate was applied later and went somewhere else for all I know. It is truly a shock to me to see a dealership do this to a consumer.

I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept. Well it was the dept who advised me about the XXXX charge for the refrigerators and they made no mention about the case regarding the fraud was denied, because HD was the XXXX doing the fraud to me. 
In this letter there is no mention about the refrigerator XXXX charge and it also states that they only received XXXX payment of XXXX in XX/XX/2015? ( THAT DATE IS FUTURE ) That payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with other payments made to pay the account off in full. They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The c/s XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the XXXX refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providingTRANSUNION with real incorrect information, slandering my name. Transunion sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Transunion and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XXXX XXXX 2015 and the personal info is dated XXXX/XXXX/15 and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type "" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XXXX/XXXX/15 and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a XXXX balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request.

03/19/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"I am trying to deal with Navient ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) regarding private loans that were taken out for my college tuition ( both under my name and with my mother as the primary borrower and myself as the cosigner. ) They have admitted over the phone repeatedly that if you are n't giving money to them over the phone ( the exact amount that they want, which is exorbitant, ) they will not document the phone call. Because of this, I have started dealing with them only via paper letters, which they have not taken kindly to. 

For the loans where I am the primary borrower, they are expecting well over $ XXXX/month payments which are unreasonable with my income. I have given them multiple financial statements over the phone, which they apparently are n't putting in the system because the next time I talk to someone there they say that there 's nothing on file. When I give them the statements, they agree that $ XXXX/month is too much, but that they have nothing else available. When I ask what they recommend I do, they say to not even bother sending the amount that I can actually afford without losing my home and car ( needed for my job ) because it 's not enough to do anything worthwhile. Then they make fun of me for not going into the career path that I was hoping to while in college and demand to know when I will be. 

For the loans where my mother is the primary borrower, she has one in a lower payment plan. We have confirmation numbers for the payments and they have been taking them out of her checking account, but then we received a letter in the mail stating that the payment plan has been rejected ( no reason why, which we 're trying to find out in writing. ) Yet even after the date the letter was sent, the money has still been taken out of her account by Navient. She 's also still receiving letters and phone calls that that particular account is delinquent, even though she 's making payments on it. 

I am at my wits end with them, trying to contact them via paper ( I refuse to talk to them on the phone anymore, as it 's resulting in me having panic and anxiety attacks every time they call. ) I do n't want to go into default, but I ca n't afford anything close to what they are demanding for these loans. I have used up all of my forbearance time on these loans ( which I paid {$150.00} every few months to put them into when it was XXXX XXXX. ) It 's almost making me wish that I never went to school at all, and also wish that my school had done a better job educating about what private loans really are instead of having me just sign a piece of paper for more money towards tuition ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. ) My federal loans are in a reasonable repayment plan based on my income ... why ca n't private loans be the same way? Please help or advise what I can do!

03/19/2015,Credit reporting,,Improper use of my credit report,Report improperly shared by CRC,"Experian # XXXXXXXXSince I received the letter from XXXX XXXX regarding the complaint listed above I have discovered that this problem has escalated and I believe that I should taking serious action as my rights are being violated. I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept. Well it was the dept who advised me about the double charge for the refrigerators and they made no mention about the case regarding the fraud was denied, because XXXX was the XXXX doing the fraud to me. 
In this letter there is no mention about the refrigerator XXXX charge and it also states that they only received XXXX payment of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX? ( THAT DATE IS FUTURE ) That payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with other payments made to pay the account off in full. They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The XXXX XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the second refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providing Experian the real incorrect information, slandering my name. Experian sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Experian and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XX/XX/XXXX and the personal info is dated XX/XX/XXXX and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type "" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XX/XX/XXXX and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a zero balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request. That was not true I had not requested the account to be closed and the credit report does not make that indication. I believe that this was done in retaliation as I am still receiving emails stating that my account has a zero balance and is active, as well as more marketing emails encouraging me to use my account. Experian has not agreed to make any changes

03/19/2015,Debt collection,Mortgage,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"The option I needed under false statements or representation was not available, but to summarize my complaint, real time resolutions is representing themselves as a mortgage company rather than a debt collection agency on my credit reports with XXXX and XXXX. 

I have a verbal recording that was consented to by them on yesterday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX between XXXX RTR employees, myself, my husband and out financial advisor where they admitted to being a debt collection agency not a mortgage company as they are illegally reporting on my credit report. I have attempted to settle the debt immediately with them if the account classification is corrected but the refuse repeatedly stating that even if I pay them in full they will leave the account on my record incorrectly. 

The property in question was a home I purchased alone in XXXX that became a rental property when my husband and I purchased another home in XXXX. The home was lost due to an illegal foreclosure by XXXX or XXXX as its now known. I attempted to rectify this situation, as my tenant and the XXXX Housing Authority failed to make timely or payments at all in some instances but my only resolve has been the receipt of an {$1100.00} settlement check from a national Class action lawsuit, naming XXXX at fault for the wrongful/Illegal foreclosure. 

As stated before if the only resolve short of litigation is to pay the debt, I have no problem making a settlement to rectify the situation if that is whats necessary to satisfy the XXXX mortgage, but it just does n't seem right that my home was illegally taken, a settlement was paid to me to provide some compensation to my family and now we are again having our credit damaged due to something beyond our control as the collection did n't take place right away but approximately 3 years later and because its being reported incorrectly as a mortgage account not a collection account, legally my family is unable to purchase a new home due to the new mortgage laws.

03/19/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I got behind in payments and worked with B of A 's loan modification dept. in XXXX. In order to keep my home, I made an arrangement for a XXXX month payoff in which I made higher payments each month until the balance was caught up. I was able at that time to make the payments high enough that I actually got caught up in 4 months. I was sent a letter on XXXX stating "" You are approved for a {$27000.00} principal forgiveness on your home loan ''. The letter stated that if I wanted to accept their offer that I did not need to do anything, if you have questions to call XXXX. I did call them because I had questions. I specifically asked that if I waited until XXXX to sell my home even if it was in the middle of escrow on XXXX, would I receive the credit on the principal balance on my loan, would there be any waiting period such as 30 days or more. I was told that I would receive the credit even if I was in escrow as long as it was after XXXX. I put my house on the market and it sold. We specifically waited until after XXXX to close and had a closing date of XXXX. It was discovered through the escrow office as I read the documents that the credit amount was still in the debit column rather than the credit. I immediately called B of A. I made multiple attempts to correct it as quickly as possible with B of A. My case manager XXXX XXXX was always responsive and helpful. It was n't until I discovered the error that B of A became unresponsive, uncooperative, provided different information on the phone each time I called, routed me over and over to different departments because "" that person was unable to assist me in that department ''. It all came to a head on XXXX when I desperately tried reaching XXXX XXXX to find out why the credit was not showing up. Reps. at B of A kept telling me that my case manager was not in and still I would get a different response each time I called. XXXX rep. stated that the credit would not be available until 30 days, another 60 days, another 90 days. I was so frustrated ; I called my attorney and was advised to file a complaint with you. On XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX. Since we had such a good working relationship when I performed my obligations to repay my modification early, she called me asking why I had contacted B of A the day before. I explained the issue with the escrow and the credit not showing up in my loan escrow docs and that the buyer is forcing the close of the house and I was going to be out the credit because it was not reflected on the statement. XXXX XXXX was actually very upset that none of her co-workers reached out to her on any of my calls the day before because she WAS in the office XXXX XXXX assured me that everything is now correct but it wo n't be reflected until I receive my XXXX statement which is typically generated between the XXXX and XXXX of each month. If I had known that I had to wait until after the XXXX statement was generated to reflect the credit, I would have waited to sell my home until that date. The buyer is now forcing the sale of the sale and I am going to be out the credit amount if B of A does not update their records immediately, it might still be too late. I did everything that B of A asked of me and fulfilled my loan mod. in 4 months rather than XXXX. I am XXXX and selling my home because I can no longer live in this particular home. I feel that I was mislead, and not provided the correct information and the EXACT date the credit would be reflected. The letter is poorly written and the customer service reps. seem to not want to help or provide incorrect information. They just want to send you from XXXX department to another to completely frustrate you so that you give up and B of A makes more money ; it seems like a scam.

Did not receive notification that auto payment option was cancelled nor did we receive information regarding foreclosure action until we attempted to make a purchase. We contacted them and asked if they could waive late fees and reinstatement fees since we were not notified. After speaking with them at length, they indicated after conducting their research they felt they were not at fault and denied any waiver of either fees. They felt that regardless of any previous discussion that they had sent written notification to us that there were no payments set up automatically, and that we should have contacted them once we received that. After advising them we did n't receive the letter they stated that we should have been monitoring our account and making sure the payments were being made and we would have known that way. Throughout a month 's worth of phone calls with multiple employees of Wells Fargo beginning on XXXX/XXXX/15, I was provided misinformation almost every time I called in. Some examples include the individuals each time had to be explained the entire story and they would explain what their records reflected on the account and none of the information was what was actually discussed. They had indicated we had never requested reinstatement letter, then that it would be mailed when we had asked for a fax ; they stated we had not received it because they were busy and to check back, and once we did they stated a second reinstatement letter had been requested ; after following up again we were told they had begun a loan modification process which was never requested ; when asking for a supervisor the call was conveniently disconnected ; each time we called the same number we received a different staff member sometimes in a different state ; every call they were asked if we could go into an office and speak with someone and were told there was none local ; after multiple requests for information sent in some other form than a fax we were told they do n't use email only XXXX.

They had said they do not use electronic communication for security purposes. We were also advised we would receive a written account of their research and determination not to waive fees which would be sent overnight mail but have not received this either. When asked if our credit had been updated to reflect that we were current, we were told they would take care of this only after our next month mortgage payment was made which is not due until the beginning of the month. The money for our mortgage payments was being payroll deducted into a Wells Fargo checking account and was sitting there rather than being taken out for the mortgage.

The insurance was again in the event I was unable to pay my bill they would pay it. Although Bank of America no longer does business with this company. The insurance company refunded the consumers some of the money and it was either sent as a check. Bank of America takes my money and than says there is not payment it is a credit.

03/19/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"My husband lost his job in XX/XX/XXXX and was unemployed for almost XXXX months. He has recently started a new job with XXXX and we are getting our finances back on track. However, by the end of XXXX, I struggled to keep up with the payments and my student loans became dangerously past due. On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I arranged a {$250.00} student loan payment on line. I did not realize until it was too late that I had forgotten to change my banking information and the payment was rejected by my bank. ( I have since cleared this up. ) I called AES to discuss further options. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by a representative that I qualified for XXXX-day forbearance. When we discussed the unfortunate payment error, she said, "" do n't worry about it ; the forbearance period would cover the non-payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, my credit bureau monitoring service notified me that my credit score had dropped by over XXXX points due to a XXXX-day late payment reported by AES. This was AFTER I was assured that I qualified for the forbearance. 

When I called AES to inquire about this, I was told that credit reporting operated on a separate system and that credit reporting was "" automatic, '' but that he would note the situation in my file. All of the representatives have been very pleasant and helpful. However, as I explained to XXXX of the representatives, I am a consumer. When a representative tells me "" not to worry about a payment issue, '' I listen. My husband and I are XXXX veterans and have to commute 2 hours to work every day. We are responsible and have not missed a student loan payment in several years. We need to buy a home closer to our work. 

The problem is this. The loans with AES are a consolidated debt of XXXX different loans. When the loans were reported to credit bureau as XXXX days late, my credit scores dropped almost XXXX points for EACH LOAN. That 's approximately XXXX points!!! This is neither fair nor accurate. When payments are made, amounts are applied to each individual loan. The way this is set up, even if XXXX of the XXXX loans is late, ALL XXXX report late. No credit report can sustain and instant XXXX point drop in credit score over something this confusing. 

Like I stated earlier, I am a veteran and a responsible citizen. I struggled to pay the loans on time for the entire XXXX months my husband was out of work. It is not fair that I should have to suffer the insult of a XXXX day late payment due to misinformation that I was given. If I am late making payments due to neglect, then I would feel like I have earned this discredit. However, I was acting on information supplied to me by a company representative. I followed their rules. Therefore, I respectfully ask that the XXXX day late be removed from all XXXX credit bureaus so that we can move on with our lives.

03/19/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I live in California, my former mortgage holder, XXXX, went bankrupt and sold our loan to Green Tree. Prior to the sell, I had never heard of this company. As a result of the sell Green Tree opened an escrow account, to pay property taxes and insurance, I never had a escrow account before and do not believe the State of California requires lenders to maintain an escrow account. My mortgage is a fixed rate 30+ year mortgage and the monthly mortgage payment is {$1200.00} and I pay $ XXXX monthly to cover the escrow payment for property taxes and insurance. According to my monthly statement from Green Tree, my regular monthly payment is {$1500.00} so I pay roughly {$11.00} per month more than is required which I acknowledge was no designated to be applied to the escrow account until I recently made my XXXX payment. Despite my attempts to comply with the terms of this loan, every year since Green Tree has held our mortgage we get a bill for XXXX of dollars, this year it was {$800.00}, supposedly because of escrow shortages. Every year it 's a different amount, but the escrow shortages are always for XXXX of dollars and the amount of insurance and property taxes we pay annually does not increase that much to justify these increases of XXXX of dollars each year. Green Tree provides this annual escrow account disclosure statement with this convoluted calculation to justify these increases ( copy attached ). This year XXXX days prior to receiving the annual escrow account disclosure statement we received a letter from Green Tree stating that our account was current ( copy attached ). Each year I contact Green Tree to get someone to explain these calculations and I have yet to understand the justification or the explanation. If you do n't pay the amount of the shortage Green Tree threatens to increase the amount of your regular monthly payment to cover the shortage. I find it hard to believe it is legal for a mortgage company to charge a borrower XXXX of dollars more per year to maintain an escrow account if it 's cheaper for the borrower to pay their own property taxes and insurance. If the borrower 's property taxes and insurance are not delinquent, then a borrower should be able to opt out of such a onerous escrow arrangement. If Green Tree is able to charge people XXXX of dollars more each year for these "" supposed escrow shortages '' it 's no wonder they require borrowers to have an escrow account. We should be able to pay our own property taxes and insurance to avoid the financial hardship that Green Tree is creating. We are currently stuck with this mortgage company, but at the first opportunity we will make every effort to change lenders. But I do n't believe we should be penalized because we are stuck with this company. A company we did not voluntarily enter into a contract with. It should not be legal for a mortgage company to require consumers to have an escrow account that costs them hundreds of dollars more per year than it would cost if that consumer paid their own property taxes and insurance. I do n't know if this practice is legal but it should n't be and it definitely needs to be investigated.

03/19/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I submitted documentation to ECMC, in accordance with their internal policy and the XXXX protocol, requesting student loan discharge due to false certification and id theft. I included a letter of material fact - examining the nature of my dispute and the history of my forced compliance with ECMC, multiple certifications of my signature ( including my government issued identification and social security card ) along with my police report citing the XXXX fraudulent accounts ECMC currently holds under my name and social security number. 

Still, ECMC has continued to insist I have not fulfilled the requirements of discharge because I have not submitted a "" court judgment '' indicating I am the victim of fraud. 
Herein lies the problem. No person has been arrested or prosecuted for the illicit activities arising from my personal information having been compromised. I have fortunately not been wrongly charged for a crime due to the illegal usage of my personal information. XXXX of these conditions must be applicable in order for me to petition for a "" court verdict '' or submit a request for certificate of identity theft judicial finding of factual innocence. 

Until XXXX of those conditions is satisfied, I can not provide a copy of any court judgment. This, however, does not nullify my claim or disqualify me from submitting other means of proof ( which I have ) to have the fraudulent loans discharged. According to Federal Regulation 34 CFR 682.402 ( e ) ( 14 ) ( ii ) ( A ) and ( B ) I am entitled to submit "" authentic signature specimens and other means of identification corresponding to the means of identification falsely used to obtain the loan '' to qualify for loan discharge due to identity theft in lieu of a court judgment. 

Not only have I filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, my local police department the ECMC Ombudsman, the XXXX Ombudsman and contacted the XXXX credit bureaus, I have ( barring the impossibility of a court verdict ) followed ECMC 's instructions precisely. It is an act of willful non-compliance that ECMC has not abided by the XXXX regulations and discharged these fraudulently obtained loans. 

I formally request that ECMC close these XXXX accounts, remove them from my credit reports and provide restitution of the {$9400.00} taken from me. Remuneration can not restore the years of damage done to my credit, nor retrieve the expenditure of time lost in arguing my case with the loan guarantor and originator, nor mitigate the stress, but the monies rightfully belong to me and should be returned. 

The following is an excerpt from XXXX of the letters I submitted to ECMC : In XXXX, after being notified by my employer that my wages were to be garnished for student loans I never applied for, from colleges I never attended, I called the guarantor of the loans and spoke with a representative that offered no alternative but a repayment plan or a prolongation of wage garnishment ( though I vehemently informed the representative I was not the responsible party, had no knowledge of said loans and was not even living in California at the time the student loans were opened ). I initially refused to pay for the loans, and in turn, monies were taken from my salary and tax refunds. I was young and uninformed. It seemed I had no recourse in the matter. I finally and begrudgingly acquiesced, in XXXX XXXX, to entering a rehabilitation program for the fraudulently filed loans when yet again, after filing my taxes, another {$430.00} was taken from me as an IRS offset. Not until this year, after having upwards of nine thousand dollars taken from me, did I learn I could file for discharge due to id theft. And even now, after submitting all I can, ECMC continues to keep this matter unresolved. I am downright exasperated.

XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and requested past Bank Statements for the period between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. She promptly pulled up the account on her computer screen and even pointed out the initial deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. Reported to me that it was open in credit status only because there were notes for pending research on fees that were supposed to be reversed over 5 years ago. She then, despite my verbal opposition and the court order in front of her, insisted that she had to close the account because I was getting divorced and should not have a joint account with my spouse and that we were no longer eligible for any applicable credits. She then assured me I would have the requested statements within 2 weeks ( records over 7 years old require the processing of a research fee-despite my physically viewing the XX/XX/XXXX Statement on XXXX XXXX 's Screen ). She then informed me that it would cost about {$180.00} in fees and that I would have to come into the branch and pay that when I pick of the Statements, implied to be just after XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this arrangement constitutes a formal contract for the reproduction of the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX Statements that she showed me on her screen. 

Today XX/XX/XXXX, after filing reports with various stake holder groups last evening ( including you ) as well as citizens bank corporate offices, I met with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX manager XXXX XXXX ( actually located at the XXXX XXXX branch ) and was informed that the account records had been purged in "" XX/XX/XXXX '' after the account had been closed by XXXX XXXX, which is would have been in strict opposition to the court docs presented to XXXX XXXX and a follow-up email on the evening of XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX ( attached ) reiterating this as well as pointing out the issue of why the account was open for credits only ( refund of fees ) as XX/XX/XXXX. 

After, in casually speaking with a Law Firm not XXXX blocks from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I can confidently say that I believe XXXX XXXX committed a criminal act, fraud actually, as a refund of $ 2,800+ in fee 's described in the attached email to her on XX/XX/XXXX would effect XXXX XXXX XXXX Profits for that branch and therefore impact her performance bonus as branch manager. 

I would also like to reiterate that XXXX XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was extraordinarily helpful and I believe sincerely tried to reverse the deletion and obtain the records for me going back 7 years. She also stated that if I get a direct Subpoena from Indiana to her she could forward it to legal, who has access to all of my account records since inception at a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as many others, but they would only comply with the Federal mandate of 7 years old ( which I have ), it is the XXXX year which is essential as it shows my direct contribution to my wife 's education over that year ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) which is relevant under XXXX Divorce Law. 

Transparency and customer access to records physically shown to me in person XXXX month ago ( XXXX literally pointed out the opening deposit on XX/XX/XXXX ) is not asking anything out of line when complying with a court order. I also believe I should have access to the exact information that she purged after my email, as I should have access to whatever personal financial information so material in XXXX XXXX 's interests that she knowingly and deliberately permanently deleted the record of it.

After XXXX weeks, they sent me a letter that actually I was late in XXXX and that for the past several years, they have been putting my payments in a suspense account and periodically took money from suspense to pay the loan. I was never told there was such a suspense account and was surprised since I was current with payments for years. In a nutshell, they set up a suspense account without telling me and while my statements from Chase said they received my payments, they did n't tell me they were applying them to some suspense account instead of applying them to the loan. Because they believe I am XXXX payments behind, they returned my XXXX XXXX payment because they want XXXX payments in full. I explained I made all the payments and do n't owe them that money. The customer service rep. has only returned XXXX of the XXXX calls I placed to her and did n't have an answer for why there is a suspense account. She would not take all my cancelled checks for XXXX but I faxed them to Chase anyway. This has been going on since XXXX XXXX. Chase needs to find the missing money and apply my payments to my mortgage and not to a suspense account. And they need to tell the credit bureaus I am and have been current on my loan. And they need to reverse the late fee they applied in XXXX since I was n't late. And last they need to let me make my payments as I have been doing for many years.

03/20/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We periodically had problems paying our XXXX mortgage to Flagstar Bankin the past. This time we were behind by around 5 months. When they would call us, we would return the call only to be transferred to other areas, put on hold and noone actually answering the call. When I was able to pay on it, Flagstar refused to take our payment ( s ) if we were not making at least XXXX payments at a time. So we started mailing our payments in using postal money orders. Then our access to our account online was totally disabled by Flagstar. We were no longer able to see the activity on the acount. all we saw was a message that said our mortgage had been sold to another servicer, and that the new servicer would be contacting us via letter. That was over three to four months ago and we still have not heard anything. And nobody from Flagstar will communicate with us. 

This is not the first unpleasant incident we have had with Flagstar Bank. They were the originators of our mortgage when we purchased our home. The interest rate on XXXX the XXXX and XXXX mortgage was high, but manageable. I notified them when my wife took ill and they suggested a modification and told us we had to be at least 90 days past due to be eligible. We did as they suggested only to have our paperwork lost. We re-submitted and heard nothing. Then we found out our XXXX mortgage had been sold to another institution. So now they only held our XXXX mortgage ( which to our surprise was actually a home equity loan ). As time went by we proceded to try and get the mortgage they held modified. We complied with all of their requests, and again, paperwork was lost or deemed incomplete. So I sent an additional copy only to have one of their employees send an email to her manager that had unprofessional remarks about our attempt to get a modification ( yes, she inadvertently cc 'd us on the email ). When I responded to both her and her manager about my displeasure of the contents in the email, the manager immediately replied to us with a favorable reduction in the interest rate along with a change in the repayment terms from being amortized over 30 years and monthly payments for fifteen years with a balloon payment at the end of the fifteen years, to a loan amortized over 20 years that pays off the entire loan in that time frame. 

It has been months since we have heard from them. And we still have no idea where our loan is.

I feel that Nationstar did not act in a timely manner and is not following guidelines for a fair loan modification on this property.

My experience with Bank of America proved that this was the case and that they were not concerned with what was in my best interest. I did all that I could within my knowledge, diligence, persistence, and power for a favorable outcome on my behalf. The crux of my grievance originates from both my XXXX hard work and expertise in finding Buyers for my property seemingly all for naught. In the beginning of my short sale request, my XXXX Realtor/Broker was able to find a buyer with cash ( proof of financials and legitimate documentation ) which was given to Bank of America during the application process. My XXXX Realtor/Broker informed me that all documents were administered in the "" XXXX System '', but was having difficulty finding them. Neither my Realtor/Broker nor I was informed by Bank of America ( in XXXX through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) that changes being made in the XXXX System would hinder the process until after the fact. Because of this, the documentation failed to be processed and I received a decline. Unfortunately, due to my Realtor/Broker 's Mother untimely passing, I elected to switch Brokers. My XXXX Broker found a Buyer right away ( as did my XXXX Broker ) who offered cash ( with all the appropriate proof of financials, authorizations, and documentation ) that offered approximately {$20000.00} more than the first offer. My second XXXX experienced the same Bank of America improprieties and challenges as my first XXXX ( i.e. not being updated by bank officials concerning the status of my short sale request ). My XXXX Broker received XXXX Declinations Letters while working on my behalf. Miscommunication or the lack of communication on the part of Bank of America since the onset of my short sale request, ; lack of continuity and/or inconsistency with bank negotiators managing my file ( where I and my Brokers were rarely able to speak with the same negotiator who was familiar with my case ), ; failure to provide informed updates to my Brokers and me as to the status of my case, ; mishandling of documentation through the "" XXXX '' system and in general by Bank of America, ; and lack of knowledge about the "" XXXX '' system ( which is supposedly the quickest and most effective apparatus in expediting documents of Bank of America short sale professionals ) was customary. I requested the short sale be initiated or reopened at least XXXX times by Bank of America 's Escalation Team, a XXXX XXXX HUD XXXX, and by Bank of America 's Office of The President. I had to go through the cancellation of my modification which took a considerable amount of time because Bank of America short sale professionals did not understand the "" full '' protocols and codes of the modification to short sale process.

I had to fax documents to Bank of America 's short sale negotiator via Bank of America Branch in XXXX, Virginia. The Branch professionals notarized and spoke with the negotiator as to what was needed to expedite the process. However, at the application deadline, the negotiator stated that she never received the documents. My XXXX request for short sale was on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX.

Unscrupulous salespersons contacted my mom many times to get her to refinance her house at a rate she could not afford and terms she could never repay. She purchased her home in XX/XX/XXXX for {$25000.00}, and houses in her area are currently appraised in the $ 55,000- {$75000.00} range. Mom finally relented and agreed to the refinance XX/XX/XXXX, 15 months after she had suffered a debilitating stroke, when she especially needed any extra money to offset healthcare costs. The loan amount was for {$180000.00} ( based on a grossly inflated appraisal ), and it appears Mom 's income was fabricated to qualify for the loan. It is an adjustable rate mortgage, with an above market start rate of 7.35 %, but it could ONLY go up because 7.35 % was also the floor for the mortgage. To make matters worse, the loan had a five percent pre-payment penalty during the first two years. The loan also had a 40 year amortization schedule, but was for a 30 year term, meaning that Mom would have a substantial balloon payment of over {$100000.00} due in XX/XX/XXXX, when she would be almost XXXX years old. Mom tells me that she contacted Wells Fargo on a number of occasions to seek a loan modification. Each time Mom says that her paperwork would be lost by Wells Fargo, or she says that additional documentation was requested ( even though Mom believes the documents were previously submitted, multiple times ). At one point, a representative told Mom that she was ineligible for a modification because her loan was current. When she finally fell behind, she says she was told that she was not eligible for a modification because her loan was in default. Mom says her multiple requests for a modification were never approved, yet she believes that she never received any kind of acceptable explanation as to the basis for the denial. At this point, she will very likely lose the home she has had retrofitted with a number of items that help Mom function more normally, such as pull up bars and other items that compensate for her XXXX and assist her with every day activities.

Regardless of what happens in our case, we hope to alert others to these unscrupulous practices and encourage our lawmakers and regulators to rein in such abusive practices immediately, to spare others the same pain our family has endured.

After asking for my general information, and my social security number, date of birth, etc., I was asked XXXX or XXXX questions about my checking account, if a home i currently live in or did live in is in a specific town, if i worked at a certain company, etc. I went through this XXXX ( because it timed out both times ) but the XXXX time I had a problem because I had to look for the deed to my home, to see the exact year it was built, the question was ridiculous. It asked the year it was built, not the approx. year it was built, but the year it was built. I bought the home in XX/XX/XXXX. It was built ( i have since found out ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I knew it was around then, but not exactly that year. The answers to the questions were : XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I mean, if i was guessing, which is what i would have been doing, it could have gone either way XXXX XXXX??? it ends up i can not get my reports on line now. I am very upset about this. The people generating these questions should think a bit before putting them out there. I recently had to answer a question for my bank and it was about a cousin of mine and if he owned land in some state, I havent even seen him in years. It is ridiculous.

I had spoken to Chase 's customer service who had asked that I provide them with my bank statements from the time to prove I had sufficient funds to make the payment.

RE: stopping foreclosure on XXXX, Florida XXXX. Case Number XXXX

XXXX,

I am writing in the hopes that this letter will help to stop the foreclosure proceedings on my home at XXXX, Florida XXXX.

I have owned this home since XX/XX/XXXX, due to XXXX procedures in XX/XX/XXXX I have fallen behind on payments due to a financial hardship. This hardship has been caused by medical expense, daily medication and the loss of the ability to be employed. Based on this hardship I am unable to keep up with the mortgage payments of $XXXX per month. 

Until XX/XX/XXXX I was and I have been gainfully employed. I have always attempted to be trustworthy and a good credit risk. While going through the recovery of these three hospital events I have attempted to find, create or be employed somehow. With health concerns and being XXXX-years old this has been a very difficult hill to climb. 

I would like to avoid foreclosure. I am committed to staying in my home. I have contacted the Mortgage lender; NationStar over XXXX-times during the past two-years asking for a reasonable solution. There has not been one response from NationStar Mortgage. As things progressed a foreclosure suit was filed in the XXXX Court system with the stipulation of going through a court ordered mediation process. The mediation was held on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The mediation was attended by counsel for NationStar: XXXX from XXXX Florida. At this mediation meeting there was no attempt to solve or come to any conclusion offering a solution or assistance from NationStar Mortgage and their represented attorney. The outcome was that XXXX would have and or offer a solution within 30-days from the mediation meeting. 

It has now been 181-days since their commitment to find a solution. There has been XXXX contact to me from their office. They have been contacted with multiple e-mails on XX/XX/XXXX with no response. There was several phone messages left on XX/XX/XXXX with no responses. XX/XX/XXXX sent several e-mail messages, no response. XX/XX/XXXX, left messaging with no response. XX/XX/XXXX left several messages with no response. XX/XX/XXXX left several messages with no response. 

It is quite obvious XXXX will not make any effort to create any solution based on the fact of their disregard of a court order for a solution by mediation. In the interim I have contacted several help sources for a solution and there has been XXXX response to date.

My home is not on the market and during this attempt to hang on I have offered NationStar a solution of a DEED IN LUE. Their answer by mail was I didn't qualify. I have tried to restructure the mortgage by sending XXXX-pages of required paperwork to NationStar over XXXX-times based on the answer they have misplaced or lost the faxed paperwork.

I would like to work with the lender to achieve a solution; however I doubt there is XXXX that NationStar will consider. I also believe XXXX has only XXXX motive and that is not to come up with a working solution. 

I hope the court can offer any consideration to avoid the complications and price of foreclosure. I would like to remain in my home to regain my health, find employment and manage home ownership. 

Respectfully,

03/20/2015,Credit card,,Rewards,,"This complaint is regarding the poor reward system for American Express and the terrible structure/policy that their company goes by. As a credit card consumer who have had at least XXXX credit cards from various different companies, American Express has been hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with. Even though you have met your spending requirement, they require you to pay off the balance and then wait for the next month 's closing date. Your points remain in pending status well over XXXX days during this process, even when you have fulfilled their requirement in paying off the balance and waiting for the next closing date, points are still unavailable. I have never had any credit cards where it takes 60+ days just to receive your points or miles even though you have fulfilled all the requirements. American Express is literally the WORST credit card company ever and I have nothing but bad things to rave about them. I will never recommend them to friends and family and will sure discontinue the relationship once one full year is near. Until they fix their reward system policies, I will never use them as a credit card company ever again. The inconvenience and lack of flexability in their reward system will never earn the business of experienced credit card consumers such as myself again.

We had good standing with this card for a long period of time despite the extremely assanine 25 % interest rate. It got to a point where certain interest points of XXXX and XXXX month special financing were dropping off and it was expanding beyond our credit limit and I was paying around XXXX dollars every three months to bring it back down below the minimum balance. After this occurred, XXXX lowered the balance and worked with us to catch it up. There was a disagreement on payment and the account went into collections after they tacked on XXXX dollars more and put us over the limit. Now it is with a collections company called Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC. 

They have been rude, and they have bombarded my phone XXXX times a day with varying phone numbers. They have initially failed to identify themselves until they try to bait me into identifying myself as "" XXXX Husband '' to which they ask for no further identification questions. They do not verify that I am indeed who I say I am but then go into how she owes money and disclose personal information. 

This is a violation of Fair Collections, This is a violation of XXXX privacy as it 's advertising that she owes a debt - anyone can pick up my phone and say they are - there are laws to prevent this and I 've been rudely told there are not. 

I am not an un-educated fool and know otherwise. A supervisor attempted to get me to identify myself further only when I started mentioning the laws in our country against un-fair practices to which she said they 'd be calling back later. That is classified as harassment and a threat. 

They have also used auto-dialers on my cellphone a XXXX times to get me to return the phone call to speak to someone. 

Please see their previous and current lawsuits -The XXXX also says that : A pending class-action lawsuit filed in XXXX District Court in California in XX/XX/XXXX claims that PRA broke the law by using an autodialer to call consumers on their cellphones without permission. 
PRA lost a class-action lawsuit filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX in New York, and in XX/XX/XXXX was ordered to pay {$350000.00} to about XXXX consumers who claimed that the company included drafts of legal documents suggesting it would sue them when it mailed them collection notices. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has received XXXX complaints about Portfolio Recovery Associates between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX*. Complaints about attempts to collect outstanding credit card bills, auto loans and other delinquent accounts include : Threatening a lawsuit or other legal actionImproper contact ( such as calling late at night or at work, frequent / repeated calls, or contact after the consumer had asked the company not to call ) Disclosing the existence of the debt to third partiesContinuing to attempt to collect debt that was not owed or that had been paid.

03/20/2015,Credit card,,Other,,"I have disputed this XXXX times but discovercard must be in cahoots with XXXX gym. 
I joined the gym and signed a contract for the regular membership in XXXX. Then, last XXXX of XXXX I decided to get a personal trainer at this gym. I talked with them and they said a 3 month program was what I needed. So I completed the 3 months. ( Actually, my XXXX XXXX went up so I could n't finish and that 's another story - trainer was going to keep my unused sessions for later, when bp was better. I have texts about this. The texts also prove my point of not even KNOWING of any contract as I am asking the trainer about my sessions EXPIRING after XXXX months ) So in XXXX of XXXX I get my discovercard and it shows they charged ANOTHER {$300.00} for a fourth month! I went from the mailbox directly to the gym. This is when I was told I hadto cancel my trainer sessions at least 30 days prior to ending and since I did n't have 30 days until the NEXT billing date, I would be charged ANOTHER {$300.00}. I was confused as I thought I just got 3 months and that was it, unless I signed up for more so they offerrd to keep the sessions for when my bp returned to normal and when I returned to Florida in XXXX from an extended trip. So I went home and just could n't figure it out how I had n't known better, or "" known ''. Next day, I went back and had the girl behind the counter print me out my contract. Turns out I had XXXX. XXXX was the original that I had signed, and XXXX was for the trainer and it WASNT signed and I had n't seen it! That explained it! They had gotten sloppy. They 'd also lost anything about me, like my diet from my dietitian, the original pre-workout measurements, etc. 
So when I called Discover card, I was told that this would be taken care of no problem, since there was no signed contract. 
I also still have text messages with my personal trainer where I ask if I have to do anything like talk to the "" big shots '' to be sure they keep my unused sessions until my XXXX XXXX improves, which is after my 3 months expire. He should have told me they DONT EXPIRE and I need to CANCEL 30 DAYS OUT!. I do n't think he was trying to scam me though. I hope not. I think they messed up and wanted to get {$600.00} more, like they normally would. Maybe they did it on purpose, do n't know. I just know my credit company should have went my way with the dispute. Their evidence they showed in the dispute was the UNSIGNED CONTRACT!! I said that is MY EVIDENCE!! What kind of country is this if they can truly do this? I think Discover is just incompetent or in cahoots, as I said before. 
Please help me. I refuse to pay this but am afraid it will ruin my credit and I have always strived to be a good citizen. I must say I 'm disenchanted. How could this happen? Nothing means anything anymore. A blank contract is good enough? How could they be so ignorant or did something change with contracts I 'm not aware of??? Thank you for your help.

I think mortgage company is not working in good faith and doing unethical practices. I fell behind on my mortgage in last few months and been trying to catch up and have been in constant touch with Nationstar customer service department along with loss and mitigation department. Last month, in XXXX 2015, I called Nationstar 's customer department and asked for the total payoff so I can payoff the loan, however due to financial hardships on my side I was not able to pay it off and asked for an extension. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called again and talked to a customer service rep and told them that I am going to pay off the past due amount or if they can send me the total pay off amount I will try to pay off the whole loan amount..Furthermore I asked them if my loan is still current and there is no legal action on it. I was assured by the rep, that there were no red flags on my account and it was not going into foreclosure and I am good to pay by XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from the third party collection agency ( XXXX ) that my loan has been transferred to them and is under trustee 's sale. I called XXXX and was told that I need to call Nationstar for them to take their case back. 
I called Nationstar customer department again and was transferred to Loss and Mitigation department, I explained to them what I was told by their customer rep XX/XX/XXXX and was told by the customer rep that I was good to pay by XX/XX/XXXX without any legal action on my account., however they were very rude and refused to help me. Nationstar litigation department also told me they were charging me extra {$1100.00} plus {$400.00} late fees on top of third party 's collection fee. I tried to talk to various reps in that department to solve this issue however I was met over and over again with rude reps, refusing to help me, I even asked to talk to a supervisor and was refused first and then was put to his voice mail, his name XXXX, left him XXXX messages between XXXX XXXX XXXX, however no response. Few days before that, I asked their department to send me a copy of total payoff and they told me I will have it within XXXX hours, however I never got anything, I called again, and now I was told it will take 7 -10 days. I begged their department to send me that payoff and remove the legal charges because the longer I will wait for the payoff the more legal charges are getting accumulated. However again, they failed to help or address these issues and Oh my god they were rude. Today, XXXX/XXXX/15, i got the payoff details via email after calling bunch of different reps and getting different answers from each one of them.

I am reaching out for your help in this matter. I do understand that I am late in my payments and I am making a full effort to bring my account to the current status. To prove that I have worked in good faith with Nationstar to bring my account to current status I have put in several calls to Nationstar in last couple of months and kept them updated with progress on my side. 
I even told Nationstar that I accept late fees on my account since I was late in paying my payments however they need to remove the legal charges since I was told XX/XX/XXXX that My account has no red flags and I have till XX/XX/XXXX to pay it off. The legal charge third party is charging me is around {$630.00} and on top of it Nationstar is charging me {$1.00}

I am writing you with a very heavy heart. I am extremely dishearten and dissatisfied with the level of insensitivity and lack of understanding and communications received from Bank of America 's representatives regarding my closed account, now "" charged off ''. I am requesting the charge off be reversed due to miscommunications and technicality. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative, who I notified that I was having hardship ( became unemployed ). She notified me that my account would be charged off on XX/XX/XXXX. Being XX/XX/XXXX was on a Saturday ( weekend ). I paid the bill on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, which was paid the next business day, XX/XX/XXXX. I had no idea my account would be charged off on a weekend and neither was I explained this information in detailed. 

Additional information : I also was told that I had a cease and desist order on my account, which too was puzzling. I never requested a cease and desist and was never told such an order would be put on my account when requesting not to contacted via telephone. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, the represented mentioned that the cease and desist stopped all phone calls and correspondence, which I would have never agreed to. Requesting not to receive phone calls is totally different then not receiving mail. I never knew there was an issue until now, because I was still receiving my monthly statements. Therefore, I did n't get any reminder notice for the upcoming charge off or notice of the actual charge off or any notice pertaining to this cease and desist order that I did not consent to. 

I have had several hardships during the course of this account from being unemployment several times, XXXX, newborn ( a bundle of joy, nevertheless a financial adversity ), accepting a XXXX "" only '' XXXX position, which was insufficient, thus having to move in with my mother, then recently in XX/XX/XXXX, becoming unemployed again. Through it all, I did the best I could. Now, that I have almost completed my payment in full, it is quite unfair and disappointing to receive a charge-off on my account for a difference of XXXX days, of which XXXX were weekend days. Furthermore, I never receive any notification pertaining to this charge-off, due to the above mentioned unauthorized communications disconnect. I thought Bank of America was in the business of helping people and that Bank of America would much rather see me pay my bill and build up my credit vs. damage my credit with a derogatory "" charge-off ''. 

I am asking that you have compassion, thereby reversing the charge-off on the aforementioned account, in so doing allowing me to pay my outstanding balance in the amount of {$1200.00} without such a steep penalty. I really like Bank of America and hope to be a customer again, when my financial situation changes for the better.

I started my own company doing right sizing -- I am brought in to save them money and have slowly built this up into a good income source. I fought the XXXX and was eventually able to get back into the house and was able to get wife out and divorce finalized. I tried to put my life back in order XXXX step at a time. I contacted XXXX to see what could be done and at XXXX point I was apparently offered an interest only modification. I found out about this after the fact, I did not see the paperwork until the offer had expired and I suspect that my ex wife who was still lurking around at that time had something to do with that. 

I have tried since then to re-engage with Caliber and have not made any progress. My business and income have continually increased and now my son who lives in the house is working as well and contributing his share. If Caliber were to actually take the time to review me for all retention options, something they are REQUIRED to do due to their acceptance of government bailout funds they would see that I fit into guidelines for assistance. Their continued refusal to even give me a seat at the negotiating table is outrageous.

However, they asked my bank account number to make the deposits after 5 % deduction of their service charge, and the credit card machine was free. 
I said, ok and in good faith gave my bank account number. 
Since I was just starting the business, I had no clients and hardly used the credit card machine. Soon, I noticed that the XXXX XXXX started to siphon out money from my bank account ranging in the amount from {$25.00} to {$50.00} a month. When I inquired, and stated that we had agreed before I started the service that they would charge me only when I use the machine 5 % of the amount of transaction. They tried to justify that they told me before hand, which was never mentioned at the beginning of the when the service started. I felt misled, so I called them up and told them that I felt deceived, therefore, they abide by the initial promise they charge me only when I use the machine. I requested them not to take out any money from my bank account, because I never authorized them to do so. The only reason, I gave the Bank account # was for them to deposit the transaction amount after deducting their 5 % charge. No term was disclosed to me at the beginning either. But they continued to take my money on incremental basis. Therefore, I called them up to cancel my services with them and they told me to return the credit card machine, which I did. Even though I asked for the acknowledgement of the receipt over the phone after tracking the machine which reached to them, they did not respond for two and half years, nor did they try to contact me. Surprisingly, the collection Agency started to call me too often and tell my social security number. I am very much worried that they are trying to extract more money from me and destroy my credit. 
As a hard working citizen, I have responsibility to support my family and then thinking of a dream home. But things like this has threatened my integrity and and the credit score. 
Therefore I request you to contact the bank and consider this case null and void and close it forever without affecting my credit.

This helps me sleep better at night knowing a fraudster ca n't open an account in my name without my explicit permission. 

The complaint I have is that not only do I have to pay {$10.00} to these companies to initiate the freeze, I also have to pay {$10.00} to each XXXX separately, every time I want to apply for a credit product. In some cases I am forced to pay {$30.00} out of pocket. I take issue with this because the problem of identity theft is largely attributable to these very organizations who provide my financial information to anyone who asks for it, "" willy-nilly '' without any sort of authentication or identity verification. So even though these companies are responsible for the problem, if I want to do something to prevent it ultimately I have to pay. 

I am requesting that the CFPB require, or simply encourage these companies to provide this service free of charge to American consumers. By doing so they will be helping to more easily prevent the serious issue of identity theft, as well as avoid more costly requirements that may come their way in the form of legislation aimed at combating the problem.

Whats even worse they just put that the loan was opened or charged off in XXXX and even put that as the charge off day every year from then on!!

The bank stopped payment on the check, I believe on XXXX XXXX, without talking to me to see if it was paid. I was assessed {$150.00} in interest and penalties which I am fully responsible for. My problem is that once the payment on the check was stopped, the bank then assumed responsibility to pay the taxes since they still held my escrow. I called the bank immediately upon receiving notice that the check was stopped and they assured me that they paid it. The county did n't receive the payment, so I called the bank again the following week. I was again assured that they sent a check, it still was not received by the county. I called a third time and was told that the check was sent to the county on XX/XX/XXXX and I would incur no more interest or penalties from the county because it was postmarked before the second month that it would be late. They did n't actually send a check to the county until XX/XX/XXXX, resulting in a second month of interest and penalties of {$150.00} which I should not be responsible for. There was absolutely nothing that I could have done to prevent the second month of interest and penalties other than call them repeatedly, which I did, because they held the money to my escrow. Instead of taking responsibility for the second {$150.00} charge, they took the entire 2 months of interest and fees from my escrow account. I called the bank a final time today, XX/XX/XXXX, to resolve the issue and I was escalated to the manager who refused to accept any responsibility for the late payment and hung up on me mid sentence.
